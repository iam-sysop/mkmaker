MachineKey Generator for ASP.NET WebForms Applications (Win32 Console App)

Simple Console App that generates MachineKey element for an ASP.NET web.config file.

Values are seeded using .NET Framework 4.5.2 System.Security.Cryptography API and Local Machine.

I speak no validity for randomness of strings generated.  
I usually generate about a dozen keys before I use one personally.
